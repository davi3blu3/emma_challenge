I'm Dave Harned, submitting my response to Emma Inc's Code Challenges, on 8/14/16.

Challenge A)

Write a function (Javascript, Python, or Scala).
The function *must* accept a list of URLs and return a subset of those links that are either written incorrectly or do not return a success status code, alone with a way to identify what was wrong with each link.

Challenge B)

Write a front-end single page app (Javascript + React).
The application must include a form with a single input for a valid URL. Submitting the form will request the URL, and the application must parse the HTML response, generate a list of links contained on the page, and display the list beautifully in the UI.

--------
To run the code:
1. Download the repository
2. Run 'npm install' to initialize dependencies

Full disclosure:
The instructions mentioned a 3 hour time limit, but didn't say whether that was for each or both challenges. I did not finish both challenges in 3 hours, so I did a git commit titled "Three Hour Mark". You can reference this to see the progress I had made in each challenge at that point, but I wanted to complete them both.
