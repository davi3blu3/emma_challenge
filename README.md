I'm Dave Harned, submitting my response to Emma Inc's Code Challenges, on 8/14/16.

Challenge A)

Write a function (Javascript, Python, or Scala).
The function *must* accept a list of URLs and return a subset of those links that are either written incorrectly or do not return a success status code, alone with a way to identify what was wrong with each link.

Challenge B)

Write a front-end single page app (Javascript + React).
The application must include a form with a single input for a valid URL. Submitting the form will request the URL, and the application must parse the HTML response, generate a list of links contained on the page, and display the list beautifully in the UI.
